the resumAPI spec

### About
resumAPI is intended to facilitate effortless hiring and job applications. It does this by dropping all the glitz and glamour, and focusing instead on the data. The specification provides a standardized structure, primarily in JSON (although it is format agnostic), that allows individuals to publish their resume/CV data via a web API endpoint. An individual could self-host their their endpoint, or host it on platforms such as GitHub pages, enabling potential employers to retrieve their complete resume/CV using a format that remains consistent across applicants. Access to such endpoints can be restricted through single-use tokens, enabling the user to define the scope and time frame of access. Firms have the opportunity to simplify their job application processes, with the primary application process revolving around providing a valid resumAPI endpoint, ensuring structured, consistent data input that can easily be integrated into their systems. The key advantage is the standardization of data, enabling firms to effortlessly assimilate and process it. Individuals, too, benefit from streamlined job applications, which will reduce the stress of the job application process and enable them to apply to a wider range of opportunities.
